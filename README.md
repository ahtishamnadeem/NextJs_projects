🚀 My First Next.js Hello World Program.

🎯 Introduction:
Welcome to my first Next.js project! After working with various technologies, I have started exploring Next.js, a powerful React framework for building modern web applications. This is my first step into the world of server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and full-stack web development with Next.js.
